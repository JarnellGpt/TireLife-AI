# 🛞 TireLife.AI

**Predictive Tire Health Assistant** — built to help vehicle owners monitor tire wear, pressure, and replacement needs before failure happens.

---

## 🚀 Overview

TireLife.AI is a smart diagnostic tool designed to estimate tire tread wear, predict replacement timelines, and detect underinflation — all from simple user inputs. No sensors required. Just enter your mileage, pressure, and driving habits, and TireLife will do the rest.

> Created by Jarnell + Sunraku, for a smarter, safer road experience.
